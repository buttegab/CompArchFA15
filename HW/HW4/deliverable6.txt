Deliverable 6:
There is a 5 bit input for the address, a single bit for the enable, and it results in a 32 bit output.
Out is the result of enable being shifted left by the address, which is capable
of represeenting 32 possible outputs. The address pushes enable, the single 1,
to the correct output.
